    "You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. \"Thank you for visiting the North Pole!\" gleefully exclaims a nearby sign. You aren't sure who is even allowed to visit the North Pole, but you know you can access the lobby through here, and from there you can access the rest of the North Pole base.\n",

    "They've even checked most of the product ID ranges already; they only have a few product ID ranges (your puzzle input) that you'll need to check. For example:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "None of the numbers have leading zeroes; 0101 isn't an ID at all. (101 is a valid ID that you would ignore.)\n",
